# Shoutouts

Shoutout to the incredible people who assisted with data entry, provided quality UX feedback, and supported me along the way

## Data Entry

Huge thank you to Ashley, Karolina, Graysen, Anyon, and T for helping input all the data needed to bring the app to its full functionality.

As of May 1st, 2022

-   9 tours
-   30 seasons
-   64 pros
-   363 celebs
-   376 teams
-   1078 dances
-   3512 scores

We still have a long way to go but getting all of this data into the app would not have been possible without your help :)

## Usability Testing

Thank you to Ashley for providing me feedback on dozens of simple UI/UX questions over the past few months and for being my timezone guinea pig. I'm very grateful to have someone who never minds me presenting random design dilemmas to at 4 o'clock in the morning.

## Support

Thank you to my friends and incredible Twitter community for supporting me and keeping me motivated throughout the course of this project. I kept the app a secret from everyone besides a select handful of people until April 2022 out of fear the project was too much of a challenge for me and I would eventually scrap it. Those people gave me the encouragement I needed on the most difficult of days and I am very thankful to have such a supportive inner circle.

Lastly, thank you to Alan for his constant support of my journey as a developer throughout college to present day. I feel very appreciative that one of the people the app is about was just as excited to see the end result as everyone else was.
