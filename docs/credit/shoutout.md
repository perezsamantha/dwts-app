# Shoutouts

Shoutout to the incredible people who assisted with data entry, provided quality UX feedback, and supported me along the way

## Data Entry

Thank you to the following people with helping input all the data needed to bring the app to its full functionality.

As of May 1st, 2022 -> 0 seasons, 0 tours, 0 celebs, 0 pros, 0 teams, 0 dances, \_\_ scores (make visually pleasing)

Getting all of this data into the app would not have been possible without your help :)

## Usability Testing

Huge thank you to \_\_\_ for providing me feedback on dozens of simple UI/UX questions over the past few months.
