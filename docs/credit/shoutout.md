## Usability Testing

Thank you to Ashley for providing me feedback on dozens of simple UI/UX questions over several months and for being my timezone guinea pig. I'm very grateful to have someone who never minds me presenting random design dilemmas to at 4 o'clock in the morning.

## Support

Thank you to my friends and incredible Twitter community for supporting me and keeping me motivated throughout the course of this project. I kept the app and its obstacles to myself (aside from a handful of people) until weeks before release out of fear the project was too much of a challenge for me and I would eventually scrap it. Those people gave me the encouragement I needed on the most difficult of days and I am very thankful to have such a supportive inner circle.

Lastly, thank you to Alan for his constant support of my journey as a developer throughout college to present day. I feel very appreciative that one of the cast members on the show was just as excited to see the end result as everyone else was.
