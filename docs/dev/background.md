# Background

Read the backstory to how the app went from a small-scale idea to a full-stack web application

## Initial Dilemma

For years now, I have faced this predicament where I would hear a song on the radio or within Spotify playlists that had been danced to on Dancing with the Stars but it would pain me trying to remember who danced to it. Google would sometimes quickly resolve the problem but only so many dances are published on YouTube and easily accessible through a Google search. I had always wished there were a more convenient method to finding past dances especially when so many songs are reused across the seasons.

## Fall 2019

During my data structures & algorithms class, one of the first computer science courses I took in college, I was introduced to C programming. As it is a procedural programming language that can be used to build databases and compilers, I looked into creating a database system storing all DWTS content that would make searching for dances convenient. Because I was still very new to the language and a few subsequent classes made me not want to continue programming in C, I scrapped this idea.

## Fall 2020

Upon the release of ios14, I came up with the idea of making a DWTS widget that would generate pictures of the user's favorite team(s) right onto their home screens. I messed around with Swift for a brief period of time but ultimately scrapped the idea.

## Spring 2021

In my second to last undergrad term, I was introduced to software engineering and the world of full-stack applications. My _Processes for Object-Oriented Software Development_ class was a group project based course where my group and I created two full-stack web applications. The first was a simple contact manager application built using the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and the second was a housing manager app built on the MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack. In my two-semester long Senior Design capstone course, my team and I were given the task of enhancing a web application built on the PEVN (PostgreSQL, ExpressJS, VueJS, NodeJS) stack for a local non-profit STEM center.

I've always had a passion for design and was one of the frontend developers for all three apps. I only gained brief experience with JavaScript from my _Web Design_ and _Computer Graphics_ courses but grew to love the language while doing frontend development. After completion of our contact manager app, the idea of creating a full-stack web application surrounding Dancing with the Stars came to me. My ideas became a combination of my previous scrapped concepts plus new ideas that I had just discovered were possible.

At 3 o'clock in the morning one random day in March, I created a note in my phone's notes app listing out all my ideas for the app, technologies I wanted to use, and deadlines I was hoping to reach. I then sketched design ideas for the app's features, created a GitHub repository, and got to coding.

## August 2021

I graduated from college in the beginning of August with only a functioning backend, sign in/up landing page, and basic template for the main search portal. Up until May 2022, I was working part-time and would make progress in the app almost every moment I wasn't working. On the days I was completely free, I would be coding for up to 16 hours straight. Though my original (and very naive) goal was to finish the app by the time I graduated, I am proud of all the progress I've made and knowledge I've gained as a developer in the following months.

## February 2022

With the new year came the internet's newest obsession - Wordle, a simple word game where players have six chances to guess a five-letter word that's generated daily. As a spur of the moment idea, I sought out to create a DWTS themed wordle. All I had to do was modify an open-source Wordle clone, make minor design changes, and customize the word list to be entirely DWTS-related words. I deployed the app on Heroku, published the link on Twitter, and had many friends tell me they enjoyed the app and the fact our small DWTS community had something unique to interact with. This side project sparked the idea of generating a dance from a previous season everyday where users would be able to "play judge" and submit their personal scores in the app.

## May 2022

As of May 1st, the app is now public and ready for users to begin using it. A few friends and I had spent the two weeks leading up to release date inputting as much data as we could. I could have waited to release the app until every single piece of data was inputted but I decided it was time to finally release it after working on it for so long. I have many more plans for development to make the app more interactive and hope to be able to achieve them in the future.ðŸ¤ž
