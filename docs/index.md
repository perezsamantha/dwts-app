Welcome to the documentation site for the Dancing with the Fans (DWTF) web application located at [DWTF App](https://dwtf.app).

## App Summary

The app is a web application designed for mobile use and exclusive to fans of the television show [Dancing with the Stars](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_with_the_Stars_(American_TV_series)>). You can think of the app as social media for DWTS fans, where users can search through an entire database of professional dancers, teams, and dances seen on the show. They can even "play judge" by submitting their personal score for each day's chosen daily dance.

Aside from the core feature of being able to find a dance out of the thousands that have been done on the show, fans can customize their profile by liking their favorite pros/teams/dances and find fans with similar interests. After some engagement, all app users will be able to view the fan favorites by pros, teams, dances by season, dances by style, etc.

Fans also have the option to add their birthday, link their social media accounts (fan account or personal), and note which season they've been watching since.

## Developer Introduction

My name is Samantha Perez and I graduated from the University of Central Florida in August '21 with my Bachelors in Computer Science. I graduated Summa Cum Laude in the College of Engineering and Computer Science and first in my major, excited to begin applying my skills outside of the classroom post-graduation.

To be clear, I am not affiliated with Dancing with the Stars. I am merely just an avid fan who wanted to apply her software developer skills to a real-world interest. While in college, I was determined to create an app as a personal project to add to my resume and wanted the subject of the app to be something I am passionate about. The app is not monetized and I am not profiting off of it in any way. The [content credit](/credit/content/) section makes it clear that I do not claim to own any of the content or images seen within the app. My code is currently stored in a private GitHub repository, although I hope to make it open-source in the future.

I am very excited to finally share this app with the DWTS community and hope it will be of use in the most random of times, as that was the purpose I intended. Continue reading these docs if you would like to know more about the app's features and development process!
