                            Hello again everybody! I can't thank you enough for
                            being here and supporting this app. This project is
                            still a work in progress and I hope to continue
                            improving it during off-season and as we head into
                            season 33.

                            With 500 episodes over the course of 32 seasons,
                            getting every dance into the app will take some
                            time. Thank you for your patience as we work on
                            inputting data!
