                            I am happy to announce that every team, dance, and
                            individual score across 33 seasons (+ juniors) has
                            been entered in the app!
                        </Typography>
                        <Typography>
                            Please note that some YouTube/DailyMotion links may
                            be broken as many dances were entered a while back
                            and those links may been have deleted/privated. I
                            will do my best to update these links as soon as
                            possible.
